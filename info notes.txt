info001: The bell rack. Contraption used by an Alabama slave owner to guard a runaway slave. This rack was originally topped by a bell which rang when the runaway attempted to leave the road and go through foliage or trees. It was attached around the neck as shown in the picture. A belt passed through the loop at the bottom to hold the iron rod firmly fastened to the waist of the wearer. In the accompanying photograph Richbourg Gailliard, assistant to the director of the Federal Museum and also a well-known young Mobile artist, poses to show the use made of the bell rack.

info018: Illustration of the American Anti-Slavery Almanac for 1840

info019: United States Slave Trade, 1830. An abolitionist print possibly engraved in 1830, but undocumented aside from the letterpress text which appears on an accompanying sheet. The text reads: "United States' slave trade, 1830. The Copper Plate from which the above picture has just been engraved, was found many years ago by workmen engaged in removing the ruins of Anti-Slavery Hall, in Philadelphia, which was burned by a mob in 1838. No previous impression of the Plate is known to its present owner. A scene in the inter-State Slave trade is represented." The writer goes on to describe the scene as a group of slaves in chains, with a mother "fastened to her children," being sold by a trader on horseback to another. "Both dealers have whips in their hands. A ship and a boat, each loaded with slaves, are seen on the left. In the background, slaves are working in gangs, and one man is being flogged. The United States Capitol, surmounted by its flag, overlooks the scene in the distance. The engraving....is an interesting contribution to American History. Price 20 cents."
